What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git doesn't add this file to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It keeps track of what is to be commited next.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use git diff with and without --staged to study the changes from previous versions.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I want to test something. THey would help by keeping the consolidated version untouched.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They make it clear how the branches split from the master.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The files merge adding what's to be added and removing what's to be removed. Because it makes perfect sense.
