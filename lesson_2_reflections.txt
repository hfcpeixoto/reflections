What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git doesn't add this file to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It keeps track of what is to be commited next.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use git diff with and without --staged to study the changes from previous versions.
