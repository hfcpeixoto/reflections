When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If other person makes changes to something I'm messing up with, thant it would generate unwanted conflicts all the time.
