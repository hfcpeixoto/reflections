When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If other person makes changes to something I'm messing up with, thant it would generate unwanted conflicts all the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a feature of GitHub, it allows one to clone someone else's github repository to one's account. 
Clones bring remote repositories to your local machine.
Branches present a different series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So when git pull is invoked, the local repository knows from where to start the merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

With dropbox. Dropbox is easier, but it doesn't control versions as good as Git.
